Movies App ðŸŽ¥
A full-stack application that allows users to search for movies using the OMDb API, display results in a responsive grid, and manage a list of favorite movies.

Features
Frontend (React + TypeScript):
Search Movies: Fetch movie data from the OMDb API and display it in a responsive card layout.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes.
Backend (NestJS):
Search API: Integrates with the OMDb API to fetch movie details based on user queries.
PostgreSQL Database: Using Prisma ORM for database management.
